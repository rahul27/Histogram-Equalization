This program was written as a part of the final project for class EECS 220 UC Irvine to test 
multithreading on the Solaris 64 core machine.

The program makes use of the "libtiff" module to read the input and write the output file.
Therefore ensure that the library has been installed on the system used to test this code.

In order to create the executable:

type "make", this will create an object file "hist.o".

To run the program use the following syntax:

Syntax: ./hist.o [number_of_threads] [filename]

The code that reads and writes tiff files was taken from:
http://cboard.cprogramming.com/cplusplus-programming/47440-problem-reading-tiff-image-files.html

This folder contains a sample input file "IrvinePark.tiff" and output file "output.tiff".
